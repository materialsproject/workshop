    "This notebook is intended to provide a short introduction to some of the functionality of pymatgen. Pourbaix diagram and phase diagram generation require a bit more in-depth use of the API, and we don't have time to cover that here, but you can find additional examples [here](http://pymatgen.org/examples.html).\n",

    "In conclusion, I'd like to note that pymatgen development is ongoing and encourage you to get involved.  We have a [git repository](www.github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen), which you can clone/fork to customize the code.I'd encourage anyone interested in computational materials science to get a basic sense of how contributing to an open-source repository works.  You basically create a copy of the repository on github (i. e. a fork), make changes there, and submit them in what's called a pull request."
