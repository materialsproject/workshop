    "Just to motivate this lesson a bit more, I'd like to share an example that illustrates the value of atomate.  Let's say you wanted to calculate the bandstructure of every polymorph of SiO$_2$.  Normally, you'd need to get all of the cifs from MP or the ICSD, construct the POSCARs by hand, or use some of your own infrastructure to convert them, run the calculations and manage the directory structure, and aggregate the results in a way that allowed you to analyze them together.  In atomate, this is achieved in a simple, five line snippet:"
