# Materials Project Workshop 2020 (July 28 - 30)

The Materials Project Workshop is two-day interactive workshop to learn to use th Materials Project (MP) open-source tools. Topics will include basic structure manipulation, querying data from MP using the API, automating DFT calculations, exploring new chemical systems and machine learning. A optional one-day python and MongoDB primer is provided for anyone new to python programming and using databases. We'll also provide a virtual poster-session for anyone interested in networking with other participants.

## Workshop Videos

The lessons for this workshop are on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vga6eV3IAac&list=PLTjFYVNE7LTiuOK8Re7ltY0a3OHFcQhAE) and [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Uz4y1f7L5/)



## Location

The 2020 Materials Project Workshop will be fully virtual due to COVID related travel and congregation restrictions. We'll use a cloud-based python environment to enable interactive tutorials where we provide close support.
