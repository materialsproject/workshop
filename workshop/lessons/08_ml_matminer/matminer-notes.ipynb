    "1. Data retrieval and basic analysis of pandas `DataFrame` objects.\n",
    "2. Generating machine learnable descriptors.\n",
    "3. Training, testing and visualizing machine learning methods with `scikit-learn` and `plotly.express`.\n",

    "Firstly, what does a typical machine learning workflow look like? The overall process can be summarized as:\n",
    "1. Take raw inputs, such as a list of compositions, and an associated target property to learn.\n",
    "2. Convert the raw inputs into *descriptors* or *features* that can be learned by machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "3. Train a machine learning model on the data.\n",
    "4. Plot and analyze the performance of the model.\n",

    "- Where do we get the raw data from?\n",
    "- How do we convert the raw data into learnable features?\n",
    "- How can we plot and interpret the results of a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `matminer` package has been developed to help make machine learning of materials properties easy and hassle free. The aim of matminer is to connect materials data with data mining algorithms and data visualization.\n",
